                    <li>(c) Via adoption by Nutritionclock of registration details provided by the user in the networks Apple, Facebook or Google: Registration via Apple Sign-In Connect, via Facebook Connect or via Google Sign-In requires the user to confirm that the selected details, which the user previously provided on Apple, Facebook or Google, shall be adopted by the Nutritionclock network.

                  </ul>
                  <p>§ 4.2 Premium Membership.

                  <p>§ 4.3 Minors. Only persons legally capable to enter into agreements on their own behalf shall be permitted to register with Nutritionclock.</p>

                  <p>§ 7.1 Subscription Requirement. In order to use the Nutritionclock Premium Service for Premium Members, you must </p>
                  <ul class="term-list">
                    <li>(a) be a Registered User, and </li>
                    <li>(b) pay the stipulated price, including applicable VAT, if any, and any other fees or amounts associated with the Premium Services, by credit card, via AppStores, or any other form of payment accepted by Nutritionclock (the “Subscription”).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>§ 7.2 Types and Prices of Subscriptions. Nutritionclock may offer different Subscription periods so that you can choose the one that best satisfies your needs. The different Subscription types and applicable prices are available for viewing here: www.Nutritionclock.com/premium-membership or in the App Stores. All prices are subject to change at Nutritionclock´s discretion at any time. Any price changes will be announced on the Platform or in the App Stores.</p>
                  <p>§ 7.3 Payment. Payment is made in advance for each subscription period. In other words, you can select the subscription period that best satisfies your needs to access the Premium Services. Once you signed up and paid for the Subscription, the selected validity period will be associated with your account.</p>
                  <p>§ 7.4 Payments for the entire term of your Premium Membership shall be due immediately upon invoicing. Payment can be made using different online payment systems. If Nutritionclock is unable to collect any fees from an account designated by the user due to lack of funds, the user shall bear all costs arising therefrom, including bank charges related to any debit entries or similar charges. Nutritionclock may deliver invoices and payment reminders to the user by email.</p>
                  <p>§ 7.5 Automatic Renewal. When your Subscription period expires, your credit card will be charged automatically with the standard subscription price which was valid at the time of Subscription, i.e., special offer prices do not apply in this case, and your Subscription will be renewed for the same period of time unless you cancel your Subscription, at least prior to the expiration of your current Subscription. The standard subscription price can be viewed on the Platform and in the App Stores.</p>
                  <p>§ 7.6 Cancellation. You may cancel your Subscription to Nutritionclock Premium Service for Premium Members at any time by initiating the cancellation on the Platform or via the App Store. Unless otherwise provided for herein, Nutritionclock will not refund previously paid amounts.</p>
                  <p>§ 7.7 Expiration. Unless expressly provided otherwise herein, for lack of a user’s cancellation of such user’s Subscription, each Subscription period ends only upon expiration of the agreed-upon time period, and regardless of the user’s actual use of the Nutritionclock Premium Service for Premium Members during such period. Each user can check the length of the current Subscription period by viewing such user’s account information.</p>
                  <p>§ 7.8 Contact. Please contact us for any questions you might have or to report any violations of the Premium Conditions herein at office@Nutritionclock.com.</p>
                  <p>§ 7.9 Application of Other Rules. Unless otherwise specified herein, all other provisions of these General T&C apply also to the Premium Members.</p>

                    <li>(b) Nutritionclock will not update the App during this period. This means that if the operating system of your device is updated or if other relevant third party technical services change during this period, it may not be possible to use the App any longer. Nutritionclock assumes no liability for this.</li>
                    <li>(c) If you have purchased your Premium Membership through an App that will be discontinued, your Subscription will not be automatically renewed and will expire at the end of your current Subscription. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>§ 8.2 Notice. Nutritionclock may give notice as mentioned herein by informing you either by email or through communication within the Nutritionclock Products.</p>
